    <h3> ABOUT ME </h3>
      <p> I sat for my Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in the year 2015 and managed to join one of the best national girl schools in kenya, MOI GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL ELDORET in February,2016. Finaly  I sat my Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (K.C.S.E) iN November 2019.
        Coming from a lineage where coding ran in the blood, I decided to follow in my fathers' footsteps and chose to join Moringa School where am currently enrolled as a Software Developer. As at now, I have been working on my own personal projects. However, I wouldn't mind working on other peoples projects, idealy companies either startups or already well-established ones. The <strong>Main</strong>reason behind programming is my undying passion for gaming. Many at times, I have played games that i did not enjoy because from my point of view wasn't put well together and at times there have been instances whereby the games crash or fail to open up. </p>
